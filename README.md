# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose

For this project, I created a password generator that would randomly create a password between 8-128 characters of the user's choice of numeric characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters. Upon clicking the Generate Password button, the user would input how many characters they would like in their password and choose the type of characters they would like to choose. If an amount of characters not between 8-128 was inputted, or no character parameters were selected, the user would be prompted to correct their input.
